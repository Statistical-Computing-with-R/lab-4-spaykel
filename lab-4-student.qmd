## The Data

In this lab we're going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in
California. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).

The data come to us from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

**0. Load the appropriate libraries and the data.**

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| label: load-data

childcare_costs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')

counties <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/counties.csv')

childcare_costs
counties
```

**1. Briefly describe the dataset (~ 4 sentences). What information does it contain?**

The childcare_costs table provides information on childcare prices across U.S. counties from 2008 to 2018. It includes details on the cost of childcare services based on provider type (such as home-based or center-based care) and the age group of children. The dataset will be useful to analyze regional cost variations and trends in childcare affordability over time. Additionally, there is another table called counties, which will mostly be used as reference against the childcare_costs table.

## California Childcare Costs

Let's start by focusing only on California. 

**2. Create a `ca_childcare` dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the `childcare_costs` dataset.** 
*Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.*

```{r}
#| label: ca-childcare-costs
ca_counties <- counties |> filter(state_name == "California")

ca_childcare <- childcare_costs |> inner_join(ca_counties, by = "county_fips_code")

nrow(ca_childcare)  # should be 638
```

**3. Using a function from the `forcats` package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the [10 Census regions](https://census.ca.gov/regions/) in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.**  
*Hint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!*

```{r}
#| label: recoding-county-to-census-regions

ca_childcare <- ca_childcare |> 
  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, " County")) |> 
  mutate(region = fct_recode(county_name,
    "Northern" = "Del Norte", "Northern" = "Siskiyou", "Northern" = "Modoc",
    "Northern Sacramento Valley" = "Shasta", "Northern Sacramento Valley" = "Tehama", "Northern Sacramento Valley" = "Glenn", "Northern Sacramento Valley" = "Butte",
    "Sacramento Metro" = "Sacramento", "Sacramento Metro" = "El Dorado", "Sacramento Metro" = "Placer", 
    "Bay Area" = "Alameda", "Bay Area" = "Contra Costa", "Bay Area" = "Marin", "Bay Area" = "Napa", "Bay Area" = "San Francisco", "Bay Area" = "San Mateo", "Bay Area" = "Santa Clara", "Bay Area" = "Solano", "Bay Area" = "Sonoma",
    "Central Coast" = "Santa Cruz", "Central Coast" = "Monterey", "Central Coast" = "San Luis Obispo", "Central Coast" = "Santa Barbara",
    "San Joaquin Valley" = "San Joaquin", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Stanislaus", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Merced", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Madera", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Fresno", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Kings", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Tulare", "San Joaquin Valley" = "Kern",
    "Los Angeles Metro" = "Los Angeles",
    "Inland Empire" = "San Bernardino", "Inland Empire" = "Riverside",
    "San Diego" = "San Diego",
    "Far South" = "Imperial"
  ))
```


**4. Let's consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the `median` of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the `region` and the `study_year`. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.**

```{r}
#| label: median-income-by-region-over-time
ca_childcare_summary <- ca_childcare |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarise(median_income = median(mhi_2018, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = study_year, values_from = median_income, names_prefix = "year_") |>
  arrange(desc(year_2018))

print(ca_childcare_summary)
```


**5. Which California `region` had the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this `region` correspond to the `region` with the lowest `median` income in 2018 that you found in Q4?**  
*Hint: The code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.*

```{r}
#| label: lowest-median-weekly-price-2018
# lowest median price:
lowest_childcare_price <- ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year == 2018) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarise(lowest_price = min(mc_infant, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(lowest_price) |>
  slice(1)

# lowest median income:
lowest_income_region <- ca_childcare_summary |>
  filter(!is.na(year_2018)) |>
  arrange(year_2018) |>
  slice(1)

list(
  lowest_childcare_price = lowest_childcare_price,
  lowest_income_region = lowest_income_region
)
```

**6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.**

![Plot to recreate](https://atheobold.github.io/groupworthy-data-science/labs/instructions/images/lab-4-recreate-plot.png)

```{r}
#| label: recreate-plot
#by region 
#x axis = year
#y axisi is med price change 
region_graph <- ca_childcare |>
  group_by(region) |>
  rename(
    Toddler = mc_toddler,
    Preschool = mc_preschool,
    Infant = mc_infant
    ) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("Infant", "Toddler", "Preschool"),
    names_to = "child_group",
    values_to = "med_price",
    names_prefix = "med_price_"
  ) |>
  mutate(child_group = fct_relevel(child_group, "Infant", "Toddler", "Preschool")) |>
  select(c("region", "study_year", "child_group", "med_price"))

#print(region_graph)
ggplot(region_graph, 
       aes(
         x = study_year, 
         y = med_price,
         color = region)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~child_group) +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare ($)",
    x = "Study Year",
    y = NULL,
    color = "California Region"
       ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2008, 2018), breaks = c(2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018)) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6),
        panel.spacing = unit(0.4, "cm"))

```


## Median Household Income vs. Childcare Costs for Infants

**7. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) and the full-time median weekly price charged for center-based childcare for an infant in California. Overlay a linear regression line (lm) to show the trend.**

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot-median-income-vs-childcare-cost
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)

# Assuming you have a dataset `region_names` that maps county_fips_code to region names
# Example: region_names <- data.frame(county_fips_code = c(...), region_name = c(...))

# Join region names with the ca_childcare data
ca_childcare_with_regions <- ca_childcare %>%
  left_join(region_names, by = "county_fips_code")

# Reshape data to long format for plotting
ca_childcare_long <- ca_childcare_with_regions %>%
  select(county_fips_code, region_name, study_year, mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("mc_"),
               names_to = "childcare_type",
               values_to = "median_price") %>%
  mutate(childcare_type = recode(childcare_type, 
                                 "mc_infant" = "Infant", 
                                 "mc_toddler" = "Toddler", 
                                 "mc_preschool" = "Preschool"),
         childcare_type = fct_relevel(childcare_type, "Infant", "Toddler", "Preschool"), # Ensuring correct facet order
         region_name = fct_reorder(region_name, study_year))  # Reordering regions by study year

# Aggregate data by study year, childcare type, and region
ca_childcare_summary <- ca_childcare_long %>%
  group_by(study_year, childcare_type, region_name) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(median_price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(study_year)

# Create the plot with regions represented by color
ggplot(ca_childcare_summary, aes(x = study_year, y = median_price, color = region_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +  # Loess smoother
  labs(title = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare by Region (CA)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Median Weekly Price ($)",
       color = "Region") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ childcare_type, ncol = 3) +  # Create 3 separate plots side by side
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ca_childcare_summary$study_year), 
                                  max(ca_childcare_summary$study_year), by = 1)) +  # Control x-axis breaks
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Place the legend at the bottom for clarity

```

**8. Look up the documentation for `lm()` and fit a linear regression model to the relationship shown in your plot above.**

```{r}
# complete the code provided
reg_mod1 <- lm()
summary(reg_mod1)
```

**9. Using the output from `summary()`, write out the estimated regression line (recall: $y = mx + b$).**

**10. Do you have evidence to conclude there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California? Cite values from your `summary()` output to support your claim!**
